#################################################################################

Overview:
    Program Five airline-client allows the user to create and print multiple
    airlines as well as associated flight(s) from the command line. In addition,
    the program allows the user to read/write airline contents via HTTP requests.

    as flights that have a user specified source and destination. Airline contents
    is returned in XML form when request is via URL, contents are returned in Pretty
    Printer form when the request is via the command line. Please note, multiple
    airlines are supported concurrently.
